<h3 align=center>MY STRENGTH</h3>
<h4><center>My strenght is I am capable of learning new things in the field of my course. I can easily follow instructions and directions on how to create a program. Also when I have difficulties I observe and assess what am I lacking and what do i need to develop. I am also exploring the field of IT, like watching videos on youtube, facebook and other social media platforms in order to maximize and also expand my learning about my field.
<h3 align=center>MY WEAKNESS</h3>
<h4><center>My weakness in the field of IT is I am literally a complete beginner. And honesty, I know I have a lot to learn and experience for me to become a great and passionate IT student. Another thing is I am easily distracted when I encounter problems even though I follow the instructions correctly. I am really weak when the difficulty of examples or acitivities are high enough for my experience.
