<h3> <center> I am planning to become a hardware employee that focuses on building, designing, or even repair phsical parts on a computer. I really want to build my own pc someday and that is the reason why I am focusing on these matter. Another career or job that I want is to become a web developer that creates a design and also layout of website or pages. And also I want to improve my creativity on designing a website or webpage that may attract other to take time and read what is the article or content all about.
